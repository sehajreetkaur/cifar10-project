# CIFAR-10 & CIFAR-100 Image Classification

CNN-based image classification project covering both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with experiments ranging from a simple baseline CNN to transfer learning and a stronger residual CNN with progressive regularization. The repository is organized as a reproducible coursework-style project: training scripts, saved result files, prediction utilities, and lightweight tests are all included.

The main outcome is a clear accuracy progression on CIFAR-10 from a 70.0% baseline to 92.14% test accuracy, then application of the same training lessons to CIFAR-100, where EfficientNetB3 transfer learning reaches 77.55% test accuracy.

## Results

### CIFAR-10

The table below uses the saved result files currently present in `outputs/`. All values are **test accuracy**.

| Model | Test Accuracy | Evidence | Main change |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Baseline CNN | 70.00% | `outputs/baseline_results.json` | 3-block plain CNN |
| Improved CNN v1 | 86.18% | `outputs/improved_results.json` | BatchNorm, LeakyReLU, stronger head |
| Improved CNN v2 | 91.53% | `outputs/improved_v2_results.json` | longer schedule, dropout, label smoothing |
| Improved CNN v3 | **92.14%** | `outputs/improved_v3_results.json` | residual blocks, conv weight decay, stronger augmentation, cutout |

### CIFAR-100

The strongest committed CIFAR-100 result currently saved in the repository is the transfer-learning run below.

| Model | Test Accuracy | Evidence | Main change |
|---|---:|---|---|
| EfficientNetB3 transfer learning | **77.55%** | `cifar100/outputs/transfer_results.json` | pretrained backbone, cosine decay, label smoothing, fine-tuning top 50 layers |

Note:

- `cifar100/src/train.py` provides a from-scratch CNN training pipeline, but its output JSON is not currently committed in `cifar100/outputs/`
- Validation strategy differs slightly across scripts, so the fairest headline comparisons are the saved test accuracies above

## Setup

**Recommended Python version:** 3.12

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sehajreetkaur/cifar10-project.git
cd cifar10-project
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

Run commands from the repository root with the virtual environment activated.

### CIFAR-10

#### Baseline CNN

```bash
python src/train_baseline.py
```

Trains the baseline model for 10 epochs, saves `outputs/CNN.keras`, writes `outputs/baseline_results.json`, and saves `outputs/baseline_training_curves.png`.

#### Augmentation demo

```bash
python src/augmentation.py
```

Shows augmentation previews and runs a baseline-vs-augmented comparison experiment. Outputs include `outputs/augmentation_comparison.png` and TensorBoard logs in `logs/augmentation/`.

View logs with:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/augmentation
```

#### Improved CNN v3

```bash
python src/train_improved.py
```
Trains the improved architecture with augmented data and adaptive callbacks. Run `src/train_baseline.py` first if `outputs/baseline_results.json` does not exist — it is needed to print the comparison table. Saves the best model to `outputs/CNN_improved.keras` and training curves to `outputs/`.

To view TensorBoard logs after training:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/improved
```

### Model Evaluation + Grad-CAM
```bash
python src/evaluate_all_models.py
```
Evaluates the improved CNN on the CIFAR-10 test set and generates:
- confusion matrix heatmap
- classification report (precision, recall, F1-score per class)
- correct prediction examples with confidence scores
- incorrect prediction examples with confidence scores
- Grad-CAM visualisations showing where the model focuses
Saved outputs:
- outputs/confusion_matrix.png
- outputs/classification_report.txt
- outputs/correct_predictions.png
- outputs/incorrect_predictions.png
- outputs/gradcam_examples.png
---

## What Each File Does

### `src/data_loader.py`
Loads CIFAR-10 from Keras, normalises pixel values to [0,1], and one-hot encodes the labels. Returns train/test splits and class names.

Trains the current best CIFAR-10 model. If `outputs/baseline_results.json` is missing, run `src/train_baseline.py` first so the script can print the comparison table.

Outputs:

- `outputs/CNN_improved_v3.keras` for the best checkpoint
- `outputs/CNN_improved_v3_final.keras` for the final saved model state
- `outputs/improved_v3_results.json`
- `outputs/improved_v3_training_curves.png`
- TensorBoard logs in `logs/improved_v3/`

View logs with:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/improved_v3
```

#### Transfer learning with ResNet50

### `src/evaluate_gradcam.py`
- Loads the trained improved CNN from `outputs/CNN_improved.keras`
- Evaluates the model on the CIFAR-10 test set
- Generates a confusion matrix heatmap
- Prints and saves a classification report
- Shows correct and incorrect predictions with confidence scores
- Implements Grad-CAM visualisations to highlight image regions the model focuses on
- Prints the most common class confusions for error analysis
---
```bash
python src/transfer_learning.py
```

Runs a two-phase CIFAR-10 transfer-learning experiment with ResNet50 and saves the trained model plus plots to `outputs/`.

#### Predict on a CIFAR-10 image

```bash
python src/predict.py --model outputs/CNN_improved_v3.keras --image path/to/image.png
```

If `--image` is omitted, the script uses a random sample from the CIFAR-10 test set.

### CIFAR-100

#### CNN training

```bash
python cifar100/src/train.py
```

Trains the CIFAR-100 CNN with augmentation, cosine decay, label smoothing, checkpointing, and early stopping. Expected outputs include `cifar100/outputs/cnn_cifar100.keras`, `cifar100/outputs/cnn_results.json`, and `cifar100/outputs/training_curves.png`.

View logs with:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=cifar100/logs
```

#### Transfer learning with EfficientNetB3

```bash
python cifar100/src/transfer_learning.py
```

Runs two-phase transfer learning on CIFAR-100 and saves:

- `cifar100/outputs/efficientnetb3_cifar100.keras`
- `cifar100/outputs/efficientnetb3_cifar100_head.keras`
- `cifar100/outputs/efficientnetb3_cifar100_finetune.keras`
- `cifar100/outputs/transfer_results.json`
- `cifar100/outputs/transfer_learning_curves.png`

#### Predict on an image

```bash
python cifar100/src/predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

To use the transfer-learning model instead of the default CNN checkpoint:

```bash
python cifar100/src/predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg --model cifar100/outputs/efficientnetb3_cifar100.keras
```

## Methodology Highlights

### CIFAR-10 improved model

- Residual architecture with stages `64 -> 128 -> 256 -> 512`
- Batch normalization and `LeakyReLU(0.1)` throughout
- Learnable downsampling via stride-2 convolutions instead of max pooling
- Global average pooling before the classifier head
- Conv-kernel weight decay (`5e-5`) and dense-layer weight decay (`1e-4`)
- Dropout (`0.5`), label smoothing (`0.1`), cosine decay learning rate schedule
- Stronger augmentation with horizontal flips, translations, zoom, and cutout

### CIFAR-100 pipeline

- Stronger augmentation than CIFAR-10 from the start
- Dedicated CIFAR-100 CNN with four convolutional stages and global average pooling
- EfficientNetB3 transfer learning with on-the-fly resizing through `tf.data`
- Fine-tuning restricted to the top 50 EfficientNetB3 layers
- Label smoothing and cosine decay in both phases of transfer learning

## Reproducibility Notes

- The project uses the official Keras CIFAR dataset loaders.
- Headline results in this README come from the JSON files currently saved in `outputs/` and `cifar100/outputs/`.
- `src/train_improved.py` uses a stratified train/validation split and keeps the test set for final evaluation.
- Some earlier educational scripts are more demonstration-oriented than benchmark-oriented, so validation handling is not identical across every experiment.
