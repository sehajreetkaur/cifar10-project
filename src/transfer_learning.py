What is Transfer Learning?
--------------------------
Transfer learning means taking a model that was already trained on a large
dataset (ImageNet — 1.2 million images, 1000 classes) and reusing it for
a different task (CIFAR-10 — 60,000 images, 10 classes).

Why does it perform better than training from scratch?
------------------------------------------------------
- The pretrained model has already learned powerful low-level features
  (edges, textures, shapes) from millions of images.
- Instead of learning these from scratch, we just adapt the final layers
  to our specific 10 classes.
- This means we need less data and less training time to get high accuracy.
- It is like hiring someone who already knows how to cook and just teaching
  them a new recipe, instead of teaching someone to cook from zero.

What this file does:
--------------------
1. Loads and resizes CIFAR-10 images from 32x32 to 224x224 (required by ResNet50).
2. Loads ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet, without the top classification layer.
3. Freezes the base model so pretrained weights are not changed during training.
4. Adds a custom classification head on top for CIFAR-10's 10 classes.
5. Trains only the new head first, then fine-tunes the whole model.
6. Evaluates and compares accuracy vs the baseline CNN.
7. Visualises and saves the model architecture.

How to run:
    python src/transfer_learning.py

What you will see:
- Training progress for each epoch
- Final test accuracy printed in the terminal
- Accuracy comparison vs baseline CNN
- Saved model at: outputs/resnet50_cifar10.keras
- Architecture diagram at: outputs/resnet50_architecture.png
